# GUI-turing-calculatr

The Turing GUI Calculator is a fully fledged, calculator program solely based on the Turing language. 
It is using an available GUI (Graphical User Interface) library that includes commands from pushable
buttons to separate window screens. The GUI Calculator works in the same way as any standard, non-scientific or 
graphing, calculator. 

It includes 3 rows of numbered buttons, an equals button, an AC button, a Quit button, and 
a window screen to see what the user has typed in. It also includes a variety of operator buttons such as addition 
(+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), division (/), and exponents (**). 

Firstly, when the program starts, the
user has to choose any combination of numbers for their first number. Afterward, they must choose the operator that
they have decided on, it cannot be more than one operator as the program will not work an a “Syntax Error” will appear 
in the window screen. Then the user has to choose another number, also in any combination. The user can then decide to 
continue with the equation, or press the equals button to end the equation and receive the answer. 

After the answer is outputted, the user can decide to continue with the same operator and second number (buffer)  
simply by typing in a different first number and pressing the equals button. On the contrary, the user can also 
type in a new equation with a new operator and a new second number, which will remove the previous operator 
and buffer from the equation. The final program differs from the original in only a few technical ways. 
Those being the buffer system and the previous operator system to ensure precise accuracy to that of a real calculator.
